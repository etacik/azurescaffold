# Micrsoft Azure Enterprise Scaffold
Set of templates and scripts to provide a framework for enterprise subscription governance of Microsoft Azure.

This repo is meant to provide sample templates, runbooks and scripts to jumpstart the implementation of the Azure Enterprise Scaffold governance approach. In real life, scaffolding is used to create the basis of the structure. The scaffold guides the general outline, and provides anchor points for more permanent systems to be mounted. An enterprise scaffold is the same: a set of flexible controls and Azure capabilities that provide structure to the environment, and anchors for services built on the public cloud. It provides the builders (IT and business groups) a foundation to create and attach new services.
